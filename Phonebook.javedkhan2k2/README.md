# Phonebook Console Application

## Project Description

This Application is Part of Console Application Project
at [CSharpAcademy](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/15/drinks)

## The Application Requirements

* This is an application where you should record contacts
with their phone numbers.
* Users should be able to Add, Delete, Update and Read from a
database, using the console.
* You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.
* Your code should contain a base Contact class with AT LEAST
{Id INT, Name STRING, Email STRING and Phone Number(STRING)}
* You should validate e-mails and phone numbers and let the
user know what formats are expected
* You should use Code-First Approach, which means EF will
create the database schema for you.
* You should use SQL Server, not SQLite

## The Application Challenges

* Create a functionality that allows users to add the contact's e-mail
address and send an e-mail message from the app.
* Expand the app by creating categories of contacts (i.e. Family,
Friends, Work, etc).
* What if you want to send not only e-mails but SMS?
