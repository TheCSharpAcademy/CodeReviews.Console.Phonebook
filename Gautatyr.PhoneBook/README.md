# PhoneBook
Console application allowing the user to create contacts.
Developed using C#/.NET, using Entity Framework to query the SQL Server Database.

# Features
-   SQL Server Database
-   Entity Framework

## Console Based UI
-   Clean table representation made posible thanks to [ConsoleTableExt](https://github.com/minhhungit/ConsoleTableExt).

# Challenges
-   While Entity Framework was quite easy to learn and use, setting up the database in a code first approach was the hard part.

# Resources
-   Microsoft documentation
-   [ConsoleTableExt](https://github.com/minhhungit/ConsoleTableExt)
-   [The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) for general guidance
