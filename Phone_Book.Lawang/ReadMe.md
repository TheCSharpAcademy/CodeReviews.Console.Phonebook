## Deployment

To deploy this project run

- This app uses users-secrets and to initialize it run the following command.

    ```
- This will generate UserSecretId in .csproj file like given below. (UserSecretId may vary from given below)
`<UserSecretsId>79a3edd0-2092-40a2-a04d-dcb46d5ca9ed</UserSecretsId>`

- This app stores connection string in the User secrets, so to enable the connection string to database copy the code below in .NET CLI and change the 'YOUR_PASSWORD' to your database password.
```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionString" "Server=localhost;Database=PhoneBook_db;User=sa;Password=YOUR_PASSWORD;TrustServerCertificate=true"
```
- To send the Email user need to add the sender Email, to add Sender Email in the users-secrets replace 'YOUR EMAIL' with your desired sender Email.
```powershell

```powershell
dotnet user-secrets set "App-Password" "YOUR APP-PASSWORD"
```
