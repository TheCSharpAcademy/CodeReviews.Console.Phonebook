# PhoneBook

A console-based application to help you manage your contacts.
Developed using C#, Entity Framework, Twilio, Gmail, Spectre.Console,
and SQL Server Express LocalDB.

## Given Requirements

- [x] This is an application where you should record contacts with their phone numbers.
- [x] Users should be able to Add, Delete, Update and Read
from a database, using the console.
- [x] You need to use Entity Framework, raw SQL isn't allowed.
- [x] Your code should contain a base Contact class with AT LEAST
{Id INT, Name STRING, Email STRING and Phone Number(STRING)}
- [x] You should validate e-mails and phone numbers and
let the user know what formats are expected
- [x] You should use Code-First Approach,
which means EF will create the database schema for you.
- [x] You should use SQL Server, not SQLite

## Features

- SQL Server database connection

  - The data is stored in a SQL Server database. I connect to it for the CRUD.
  - The database is managed by Entity Framework.
  You should add an initial migration and update the database first.

- Console-based UI to navigate the menus

- CRUD operations

  - From the Contact Menu, you can create, show, or delete contacts.
  - From the Category Menu, you can create, update, show, or delete categories.
  - You can assign categories to contacts in the Group Contacts by Category Menu.
  To choose an option, you make use of arrow keys and enter.

  - You can cancel an operation by entering the string from the configuration file.

- Send Email
  
  - First, you need to create an application password for your google account, then
  you can enter your gmail and password in user secrets or the configuration file.
  - Then you can pick the Send Mail option, and you fill in the information needed.

- Send SMS

  - I'm using the Twilio API, so you need a Twilio account first.
  - In the user secrets or configuration file you enter the Twilio SID,
auth token, and number.
  - Then you can pick the Send SMS option, and you write the message.

## Challenges

- Getting used to Entity Framework.
- Validating phone numbers and emails.
- Sending mails to contacts.
- Working with Twilio API.
- Managing the contact and category relationship.

## Lessons Learned

- The command dotnet ef to add migrations and update the database schema.
- Constraints in EntityFramework: compound primary key and UNIQUE.
- Managing User Secrets to avoid leaking credentials in GitHub.
- Sending emails via System.Net.Mail.
- Sending SMS thanks to Twilio API.
- Using Regex to validate emails and phone numbers.
- Implementing the Factory pattern to abstract the Sender implementation.

## Areas to Improve

- EntityFramework is a bast library; I need to improve working with it.
- Class organization and meaningful names.
- The dotnet command options.
